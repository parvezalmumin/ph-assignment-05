5.What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?


Answers :


1) getElementById selects a single unique element, getElementsByClassName selects multiple elements with the same class, and querySelector/querySelectorAll use CSS selectors for flexible selection.

2) Create an element, set its content or attributes, and attach it to the DOM through a parent element.

3) An event on a child element travels upward to parent elements, triggering their events in order.

4) Add a single event listener to a parent to handle events from all its children efficiently, even for dynamically added elements.

5) preventDefault() stops the browserâ€™s default action, while stopPropagation() stops the event from moving up to parent elements.1
